Story: When user claims a reward (token) the "Your history" section will be displayed

As a user
I want to see my token history after claiming a reward
So that I could see an overview about my winnings

Scenario 1: Reward is claimed
Given that a user has won
And he has an option to claim the reward 
When he claims the reward
Then he is redirected  to "Your history" section

Scenario 2: "Your history" section displayed
Given that a user claims the reward 
When user is redirected  to "Your history" section
Then he sees previously obtained and claimed tokens

Scenario 3: listing tokens in "Your history" section
Given the user is redirected  to "Your history" section
And he has winning tokens
When he sees previously obtained and claimed tokens
Then they are chronologically ordered

Scenario 4: last 8 tokens are displayed
Given that user has winning tokens
When he has won previously more than 8 tokens
Then only the last 8 of them will be displayed

Scenario 5: displaying  tokens in "Your history" section
Given that user sees previously obtained and claimed tokens
When he has different kind of tokens
Then each winning token is displayed as 1 characteristic thumbnail 

Scenario 6: displaying  same kind of tokens
Given that user has winning tokens
When he has same kind of tokens
Then they have the same characteristic thumbnail
And are displayed as different winnings 

was not in business requirement but it is in the design:

Scenario 6: action in "Your history" section
Given that a user is "Your history" section
When he is pointing a mouse to one of his token
Then he sees a tokens name displayed

Scenario 7. Freespin is displayed
Given that user has winning tokens
When he has a freespin opportunity with the token
Then he has a freespin icon displayed on the token


back-end scenarios

As a system
I want to receive token history in a JSON format
So that I could see an overview about user winnings

Scenario 1: possible to request
Given that system has a path for method "/igc/betspin/rewards/history" 
When the system has possibility to request from method
Then the response is gettable with only 1 param "userName"

Scenario 2: request is filled with param 
Given that system will requests from method /igc/betspin/rewards/history
And the requests is filled with param "userName"
When the request is made
Then the response is in JSON format

Scenario 3: listing in array and sub-array
Given that the requests is filled with param "userName"
When the response is in JSON format
Then winning tokens are listed in array  
When claiming unique token more than once 
Then the unique tokens are listed as sub-array objects

Scenario 4: information in JSON 
Given that the tokens are won more than once
And they are in sub array
When information is listed in JSON
Then it contain following information: game-slug,date claimed, info, reason, expiry date

Scenario 5: response order in JSON
Given the response is in JSON format
And there are more than one unique token
When the tokens list is received
Then its in chronological order by information "date claimed"


Extra discussion ideas:

1) would he be able to see token history, so user would know when they are expired?
2) if the expired date is passed, should we still show them if they are included at the last 8?
3) looking at the design, will the section fit 8 tokens (scrollbar needed or etc.) ?
